            <h2>System Failure</h2>
            <p>Where survival is a choice… A tantalizing blend of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Romance</p>
            <p>Avelyn Pierce never expected to survive long enough to leave Earth, but when she risks everything
                to stow away on the last spacecraft alongside her younger brother Noah, survival becomes more
                complex than she ever imagined. Fleeing a dying planet, they find themselves stranded on an
                uncharted world where nothing is as it seems. Strange, towering forests stretch towards an alien
                sky, hiding creatures that blend metal and flesh, and the air itself hums with secrets too
                dangerous to uncover.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Beside Avelyn is Alex, a brooding, battle-hardened pilot who views her as a
                liability from the
                start. Unimpressed by her fragile appearance, Alex quickly discovers that there’s more to her
                than meets the eye. Both must navigate their distrust for each other while trying to protect
                Noah, whose presence on the ship was never intended and puts all their lives at risk.</p>

            <p>With humanity’s fate hanging in the balance and a planet filled with strange
                lifeforms—some of
                which seem more predator than prey—the trio must face dangers beyond their imagination. As
                Avelyn proves her worth in this perilous world, she and Alex will have to reckon with a truth
                they can’t outrun: the real threat might not be from the creatures lurking in the alien
                wilderness but from within their own group.</p>

            <p>The race for survival begins, and in a world where everything could kill
                them, they’ll need each
                other more than ever.</p>
